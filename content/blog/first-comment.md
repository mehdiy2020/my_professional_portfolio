title: Why I am Here?
---

This is re-phrasing of a quote from a podcast: "to be a winner in any arguments you need data science along with its nuts and bolts". But this has another side to it. I am not into defeat anyone to be a winner. I am here to enjoy revealing unbidden fact. However, when data scientists "Reject" or "Fail to Reject" any hypothesis, their argument(s) place them on the winner side.  

At the same time there must a clear goal for it. The goal that increases tangible and intangible values for any stakeholders and un-tie a possible convoluted tie.
